## RESTful API for a URL shortener service. 

The RESTful API service should have the following features:
v1:
- User Registration.
- User Login (returns API key using Sanctum).
- Using the API key one can send a long URL and will get a shortened one in response. (If the long URL is already in the system, donâ€™t create a new shortened URL, return the previous one). Only the users with a valid API key can use this service. 
- Ensure that all shortened URLs are unique so that they do not collide and cause unwanted bugs. But if a user submits the same Long URL multiple times, they'll get the same short URL for that long URL.
- If we browse any shortened URL in the browser, it should redirect us to the actual URL (You should create a simple redirect web route for this, not an API route).

v2: 
- Manage multiple versioning of the API.
 
Notes: Without UI.
